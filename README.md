# AWS-Cloud-Resume
## Project Background
I recently happened accross the concept of this challenge and thought "That looks like a fun/useful little project I can do to learn and play in the cloud!"
I found all the info [here.](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/)  There's a book, a site and apparently a whole community surrounding this idea, I learned all the particulars by sniffing around there, but by then I had already determined I was gonna do this thing my way! :sunglasses: (but stick to the outline)
  
I had previously created a "Secure Static Website on AWS" just as a lab project and tutorial for my youtube channel [@cloudoptimized](https://www.youtube.com/@cloudoptimized?sub_confirmation=1). That [project](https://youtu.be/gnj4yEO4I0I) was created using the AWS console only, I'm gonna do as much of this one as I can in "Infrastructure as Code".
