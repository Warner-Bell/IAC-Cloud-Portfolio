# Cloud-Resume

https://coming-soon.com

## Project Background
I recently happened accross the concept of this challenge and thought :astonished:"That looks like a fun/useful little project I can do to learn and play in the cloud!"

I found all the info [here.](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/)  There's a book, a site and apparently a whole community surrounding this idea, I learned all the particulars by sniffing around there, but by then I had already determined I was gonna do this thing my way! :sunglasses: (but stick to the outline)
  
I had previously created a "Secure Static Website on AWS" just as a lab project and tutorial for my youtube channel [@cloudoptimized](https://www.youtube.com/@cloudoptimized?sub_confirmation=1). 

That [project](https://youtu.be/gnj4yEO4I0I) was created using the AWS console only, I'm gonna do as much of this one as I can in "Infrastructure as Code".

Whatever it is I'll be doing it with a smile...mostly..lol

### 2. HTML

For my HTML you'll see an example of a basic configuration resume with basic HTML within this code base but for the actual website I will be re-vamping one of the free sample site templates from [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/). They have some amazing offerings 100% FREE! under their [creative commons](https://html5up.net/license). You can even get some custom attibution-free stuff, they are worth a look.

### 3. CSS

Same deal with the CSS, you'll see an example of a basic configuration resume with basic CSS within this code base but for the actual website I will be modifying a templates from HTML5UP.

### 4. Static Website

This will be a fully responsive static portfolio website hosted on AWS S3, essentially re-creating [this](https://medium.com/@Warner_Bell/build-a-secure-static-website-using-s3-cloudfront-acm-and-route-53-ab1a0aee1ef9) project using AWS CLI, CDK, and infrastructure as code, following the structure layed out by the cloud resume challenge where possible.
